Issues and bugs are best kept track of and organized on GitHub as that is one of its core features. As for open discussion
of current and future plans, forums like StackOverflow and especially Reddit are great places for wider communities to plan and discuss open source
software / projects. They let people get feedback from the community in a short period of time as well as pull knowledge / experience from others.
Preferably, for code to be contributed and accepted into the project, it could follow the same guidelines most open source projects follow where
an admin(s) choose what code is actually integrated after testing it and making sure it passes test cases. Normally, projects like this have
small, dedicated communities as opposed to large ones, so the GitHub can be left public for any contributions on personal branches, with pull 
requests being tested.
